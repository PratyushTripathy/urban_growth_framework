## Autotuning Library\n",

The file *autotuning.py* contains the main code which is used to run experiments. There are two notebooks with an example for a classification and regression task, those are : *classification\\_example\\_notebook.ipynb* and *regression\\_example\\_notebook.ipynb*. In these notebooks you can learn how to use the library, and obtain the results. A version of this notebooks can be found as python code in *classification\\_example\\_python.py* and *regression\\_example\\_python.py*.

To run an experiment it is necessary to have a JSON file with the models and hyperparameters that will be used in the autotuning process. For the examples we used the files *classification\\_example\\_parameters.json* and *regression\\_example\\_parameters.json*. You can look at the file *JSON\\_guide.pdf* to know how to modify the JSON file to your necessties, furthermore there are two files called *classification\\_template.json* and *regression\\_template.json* which have a lot of models and hyperparameters already set, it could be a good starting point.

The dependecies required to use the library can be found in the file *requirements.txt*

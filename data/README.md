## Data
In these folders, you can find the input variables that we used in the paper for both cities: Valledupar and Rionegro. In each folder, you will find three additional folders: input, intermediate, and output. The input folder contains the data before the preprocessing, the intermediate folder contains the data after pre-processing, and finally, the output folder contains the results of the simulation process for the three main variables: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in RGB color. Each one of these folders contains a *.tif* file and its name corresponds to the year that it represents. In the input and intermediate folders, you will find two *.xlsx* files with the information about the official population statistics and the urban population ratio for each administrative division.
